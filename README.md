A small Container to serve Grav CMS with Nginx/PHP-FMP with PHP 8.1. 
I run this on render.com.

[Docker HUB:
](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/maikfree/grav-alpine/)https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/maikfree/grav-alpine/

To deploy for free on Render.com click to Web-Services and the second option. Paste the Docker HUB Image URL, set the Name and click to Deploy.
Thats it.
